# Crystal-Games

This simple web application game uses Javascript and jQuery

I have tried to write minimal codes as possible.

As a stating point I initalized the score, win and loose as 0 at ver first.

Then write a function which create the random number between any two number. I applied the random number for all gems and the target as well.

Then wrote another ( scores (points)) function which will add the points and will compare score agains target

Then I wrote a click function which will trigger  scores (points) and will also check is the added score = target or score > target.

if score = target then, it will add one points to win and if the score is higher then to loose.

In both scenerios the randomfunction will trigger again and new random number will be allocated to the gems.
